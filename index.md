I am a research scientist at Intel Labs where I am working in the Deep Reinforcement Learning team. Before Intel Labs, I was a graduate student at University of Central Florida under Ladislau Boloni.

My current research interests revolve around multi-agent reinforcement learning, evolution guided reinforcement learning and more recently, offline reinforcement learning
