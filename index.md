My name is Hassam Ullah Sheikh. I am a third year PhD student at University of Central Florida in Orlando. My current research revolves around multi-agent learning especially training multi-agent reinforcement learning agents for security related problems using robots. My secondary research includes Bayesian learning, imitation learning and robot control.

Before coming to UCF, I was a Masters student in Advanced Artificial Intelligence at University of Manchester where I worked under Dr Ke Chen. Before that, I did my undergraduate in Computer Engineering at University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore, Pakistan.
